# Contribute A Small Fix

## Companion Guidance

Use `karpathy-guidelines` alongside this skill for implementation or review
work. Keep changes scoped, surface assumptions, and define focused validation
before editing.

Use this skill for narrowly scoped bug fixes or behavior corrections.

## Rules

- reproduce or identify the failing behavior first
- keep the change as small as possible
- avoid opportunistic refactors unless they are required to fix the bug safely
- add or update the smallest meaningful test that proves the fix

## Checklist

- [ ] scope of the fix is explicit
- [ ] affected language surfaces are understood
- [ ] a regression test or focused validation path exists
- [ ] docs updated if public behavior changed
- [ ] PR notes can explain what failed before and why the fix is safe

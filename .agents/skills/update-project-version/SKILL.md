# Update Project Version

## Companion Guidance

Use `karpathy-guidelines` alongside this skill for implementation or review
work. Keep changes scoped, surface assumptions, and define focused validation
before editing.

Use this skill when changing the released NeMo Flow version, including
pre-release or build-metadata variants used during packaging.

## Source Of Truth

- `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package].version` is the source of truth for the Rust
  workspace and Python build versioning.
- Keep `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]` self-references aligned when the
  workspace version changes.
- `crates/node/package.json` carries its own npm package version and must stay
  aligned with `crates/node/package-lock.json`.
- `crates/node/package-lock.json` needs both the top-level `version` and the
  root entry under `packages[""].version` updated together.
- `crates/wasm/package.json` is a local dev manifest. Do not treat it as the
  publishable package manifest unless it gains an explicit `version` field.
- The publishable WASM npm package version is derived from
  `crates/wasm/Cargo.toml` through `wasm-pack` output plus
  `crates/wasm/scripts/prepare_pkg.mjs`.

## Workflow

1. Read the current version from `Cargo.toml` and decide the exact target
   version string.
2. Update `Cargo.toml`:
   - `[workspace.package].version`
   - `workspace.dependencies.nemo-flow.version`
   - `workspace.dependencies.nemo-flow-adaptive.version`
3. Update Node package metadata manually. `set_npm_version` in `justfile` is a
   bash helper used by packaging recipes such as `package-node`; it is not a
   callable `just` recipe. Use `set_npm_version` only as a reference for which
   fields must change together:
   - `crates/node/package.json` `version`
   - `crates/node/package-lock.json` top-level `version`
   - `crates/node/package-lock.json` `packages[""].version`
4. Refresh generated surfaces:
   - Run `cargo check --workspace` to refresh `Cargo.lock` if workspace package
     entries changed.
   - If Cargo metadata changed and committed attribution files must stay fresh,
     regenerate `ATTRIBUTIONS-Rust.md` with
     `./scripts/generate_attributions.sh rust`.
   - If `crates/node/package-lock.json` changed, regenerate
     `ATTRIBUTIONS-Node.md` with
     `./scripts/generate_attributions.sh node`.
   - If the change needs WASM publish validation, rebuild the generated package
     with `just build-wasm` or
     `NEMO_FLOW_WASM_RELEASE=1 npm --prefix crates/wasm run build:pkg`. Inspect
     `crates/wasm/pkg/package.json`, not `crates/wasm/package.json`.
5. Audit remaining references to the old version with targeted search. Separate
   true version pins from examples, generated attribution files, and unrelated
   third-party versions.

## Validation

- `rg -n '^version =|nemo-flow = \\{ version =|nemo-flow-adaptive = \\{ version =' Cargo.toml`
- `rg -n '\"version\"' crates/node/package.json crates/node/package-lock.json`
- `cargo check --workspace`
- If Rust attribution files are expected to stay current:
  `./scripts/generate_attributions.sh rust`
- If Node packaging changed materially: run `npm install --ignore-scripts` or
  stronger Node validation in `crates/node`
- If validating the WASM publish surface: inspect the regenerated
  `crates/wasm/pkg/package.json`

## Release Notes

- `just package-node`, `just package-python`, and `just package-wasm` may stamp
  temporary non-release versions for packaging. Do not commit those temporary
  suffixes as the canonical project version unless the release process requires
  that exact string.

## Avoid

- updating only `Cargo.toml` or only Node package metadata
- assuming `crates/wasm/package.json` is the published npm manifest
- forgetting `Cargo.lock`, `ATTRIBUTIONS-Rust.md`, or `ATTRIBUTIONS-Node.md`
  after changing versioned inputs that feed them
- doing blind repository-wide search/replace across docs, patches, and
  generated attribution files

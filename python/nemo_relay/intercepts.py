"""Global middleware intercept registration for tools and LLMs.

Request intercepts transform inputs before execution. Execution intercepts wrap
the downstream callable and can observe, modify, or replace the result.

Example::

    import nemo_relay

    def add_header(
        name: str,
        request: nemo_relay.LLMRequest,
        annotated: nemo_relay.AnnotatedLLMRequest | None
    ) -> nemo_relay.LLMRequestInterceptOutcome:
        # The request object is immutable, however we can return a new instance with updated headers.
        headers = request.headers.copy()
        headers["X-Trace"] = "demo"
        return nemo_relay.LLMRequestInterceptOutcome(
            nemo_relay.LLMRequest(headers=headers, content=request.content), annotated
        )

    nemo_relay.intercepts.register_llm_request("trace-header", 10, False, add_header)

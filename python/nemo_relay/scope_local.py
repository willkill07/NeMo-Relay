"""Scope-local middleware and subscriber registration.

These helpers mirror the global ``guardrails``, ``intercepts``, and
``subscribers`` modules, but the registrations apply only while the owning
scope is active. When that scope is popped, the registrations are removed
automatically.

    import nemo_relay

    def redact(tool_name, args):
        return {**args, "api_key": "***"}

    with nemo_relay.scope.scope("request", nemo_relay.ScopeType.Agent) as handle:

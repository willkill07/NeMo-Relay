# NeMo Relay Codex Observability

This package contains Codex hook entries that forward canonical Codex hook JSON
to `nemo-relay` at `/hooks/codex`.

Codex CLI is fully supported for local sessions. Codex GUI or app sessions are
supported only when they run locally and honor the same hook/plugin config and
provider routing. Cloud or remote Codex tasks are partial or unsupported for
local gateway LLM capture.

Requires `codex-cli >= 0.129.0` (introduced the `features.hooks` flag and the
provider alias surface the gateway relies on).

## Files

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` describes the Codex plugin package.
- `hooks/hooks.json` contains hook entries that run
  `nemo-relay hook-forward codex`.

## Captured Events

The bundle forwards `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `SubagentStart`,
`SubagentStop`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`,
`Notification`, and `PreCompact` as scope, tool, or mark events.
`UserPromptSubmit`, `AfterAgentResponse`, `AfterAgentThought`, and `Stop`
provide private LLM correlation hints for gateway requests.

Transparent setup injects these hooks with CLI config overrides. Persistent
setup writes `features.hooks = true` in `.codex/config.toml` and merges the
hook entries into `.codex/hooks.json`.

## Transparent Setup

Build or install the gateway binary so `nemo-relay` is on `PATH`.

Run Codex through the wrapper:

```bash
nemo-relay run -- codex
```

The wrapper starts a per-invocation gateway on a dynamic localhost port,
enables Codex hooks with CLI config overrides, injects hook commands that use
`NEMO_RELAY_GATEWAY_URL`, and points Codex at a temporary `nemo-relay-openai`
provider alias that uses the gateway URL while preserving Codex's OpenAI auth
path.

Inspect the launch without starting Codex:

```bash
nemo-relay run \
  --dry-run \
  --print \
  -- codex
```

## Shared Config

Use `.nemo-relay/config.toml` for project defaults or
`~/.config/nemo-relay/config.toml` for user defaults:

```toml
[agents.codex]
command = "codex"
```

Configure observability with `nemo-relay plugins edit --project` or
`.nemo-relay/plugins.toml`:

```toml
version = 1

[[components]]
kind = "observability"
enabled = true

[components.config.atif]
enabled = true
output_directory = ".nemo-relay/atif"
```

Then run:

```bash
nemo-relay run --agent codex
```

## Standalone Gateway

Use the long-running gateway only when you do not want to launch Codex through
the wrapper. Start the gateway manually:

```bash
nemo-relay --bind 127.0.0.1:4040
```

Then edit `~/.codex/config.toml` and configure local Codex to use a gateway
provider alias instead of overriding the reserved built-in `openai` provider:

```toml
model_provider = "nemo-relay-openai"

[model_providers.nemo-relay-openai]
name = "NeMo Relay OpenAI"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4040"
wire_api = "responses"
requires_openai_auth = true
supports_websockets = false
```

After saving the file, restart the Codex GUI or app so it reloads the provider
configuration. For CLI usage, start a new `codex` process.

Some Codex GUI or app versions appear to scope visible conversation history by
the active provider configuration. If existing conversations disappear after
switching `model_provider` to `nemo-relay-openai`, the history has not been
removed if it returns after restoring the previous provider configuration. Use
this standalone provider alias only while capturing gateway telemetry, or prefer
the transparent wrapper for CLI sessions. See the upstream Codex
[history visibility discussion](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/15494#issuecomment-4164170537)
for context.

## Verify

Run a Codex session that starts, uses one simple tool, and ends. Confirm that
ATIF was written:

```bash
ls .nemo-relay/atif
```

For a direct endpoint smoke test against a manually started gateway:

```bash
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:4040/healthz
printf '{"session_id":"smoke-codex","hook_event_name":"sessionStart"}' \
  | NEMO_RELAY_GATEWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4040 nemo-relay hook-forward codex --fail-closed
```

If hooks arrive but LLM spans are missing, confirm Codex was started by
`nemo-relay run` or that the active provider points to the gateway URL.

If LLM spans are present but attached to the top-level agent instead of a
subagent, include `x-nemo-relay-subagent-id` on gateway requests or share
`conversation_id`, `generation_id`, or `request_id` values between hook payloads
and provider requests.

# Rust Native Dynamic Plugin

This example shows a trusted in-process Rust dynamic plugin using the
high-level `nemo-relay-plugin` SDK. It builds as a `cdylib`, exports a stable
native ABI entry symbol, validates JSON config, registers middleware and
subscribers, emits runtime marks/scopes, and creates an isolated scope stack.

The example intentionally depends on `nemo-relay-plugin`, not on the host
`nemo-relay` runtime crate. Rust DTOs stay inside the plugin crate; the
dynamic-library boundary remains the stable C ABI.

## Build

Run this command from the example directory:

```bash
cargo build
```

Before you register the plugin, copy `relay-plugin.toml` to a local manifest and
replace both occurrences of `<platform-library-file>` with the file name that
`cargo build` creates for your platform:

| Platform | Library path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `target/debug/libnemo_relay_rust_native_plugin_example.dylib` |
| Linux | `target/debug/libnemo_relay_rust_native_plugin_example.so` |
| Windows | `target/debug/nemo_relay_rust_native_plugin_example.dll` |

The copied manifest must use the same relative path for `source.artifact` and
`load.library`. Calculate the library's SHA-256 digest and replace
`<artifact-sha256>` with the lowercase hexadecimal value:

| Platform | Digest command |
|---|---|
| macOS | `shasum -a 256 <library-path>` |
| Linux | `sha256sum <library-path>` |
| Windows PowerShell | `(Get-FileHash <library-path> -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()` |

Keep the `sha256:` prefix in the manifest. For example, a digest of `abc123`
is written as `sha256:abc123`.

## Register With Relay

After materializing the library path and digest, run these commands from the
repository root using the copied manifest path:

```bash
nemo-relay plugins add ./examples/rust-native-plugin/relay-plugin.local.toml
nemo-relay plugins enable examples.rust_native_policy
```

You can also reference the manifest manually from `plugins.toml`:

```toml
[[plugins.dynamic]]
manifest = "./examples/rust-native-plugin/relay-plugin.local.toml"

[plugins.dynamic.config]
tag = "demo"
block_tools = false
block_llms = false
emit_isolated_scope = true
```

Start the gateway normally after the dynamic record is enabled:

```bash
nemo-relay --bind 127.0.0.1:4040
```

## What the Example Registers

The example registers the following runtime behavior:

- A subscriber that emits a mark when it sees non-plugin scope starts.
- Tool sanitize request/response guardrails for observability payload tagging.
- Conditional execution guardrails for tools and LLMs controlled by config.
- Request and execution intercepts for tools that mutate JSON payloads and call
  continuations.
- LLM sanitize request/response guardrails.
- LLM request, execution, and stream execution intercepts.
- Runtime mark and scope events.
- A plugin-owned isolated scope stack for non-correlated visibility.

Native plugins are not sandboxed. They run in the Relay process and must not
unwind across ABI callbacks.

# Scripts

The canonical build and test surface now lives in the repository `justfile`.
Use `just --list` to discover supported developer workflows.

Keep `scripts/` focused on helpers that are still script-native:

## Top-Level Commands

- `build-docs.sh`: compatibility wrapper around the Fern documentation validation recipe; it regenerates ignored Fern API reference pages before checking the site
- `generate_attributions.sh`: regenerate attribution documents

## Internal Layout

- `docs/`: Fern reference-generation, migration cleanup, and `docs-website` branch sync helpers. Generated API reference output under `docs/reference/api/*-library-reference/` is ignored and recreated by `just docs`.
- `licensing/`: attribution generation helpers, including license inventory diff scripts
- `lint/`: pre-commit and local lint helpers
- `test-support/`: shared test utilities
